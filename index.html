        <p> With a population of <strong> 2.2 million</strong>, Paris is by far France's largest city. Paris sees upwards of <strong> 16 million </strong> international visitors a year. There are so many things to see and do in Paris that it’s hard to pick only a few.

        <br> Paris is a global city and you’ll find excellent food from around the world here. But if you’re looking for traditional Parisian fare, try a salade <em> composée </em> in a café, or head to a boulangerie and enjoy a <em> baguette </em>. Paris is known for having the best baguettes in France — there’s even a yearly competition for the best one in the city. But we can't forget famous <em> Eiffel Tower </em> , <em> Notre-Dame de Paris </em> and many great restaurants around the city. Enjoy the gallery.  </p>

        <h3> LYON </h3>
        <p> Lyon is located near the Swiss border, 300 miles south of Paris. Considered by locals to be France's <em> "second city" </em> , Lyon has the third largest population in the country with roughly <strong> 500,000 residents </strong> . It is known as the gastronomical capital of France, as its streets are lined with gourmet eateries. In addition to its tasty cuisine, Lyon is of great <strong> geographical importance </strong> , serving as the main hub between Paris, the south of France, the Swiss Alps, Italy, and Spain. Lyon's history goes back to the height of the Roman Empire, when Lyon (known then as Lugdunum) was a major city. People from Lyon are very proud of their city’s <strong> history and culture </strong> , and you’ll find lots of both here today. <br>
        <br>The city is also known for a few pastries and treats, including brioche <em> Saint-Genix </em> , a brioche that looks like something a kid would create, with its sloppy topping of colorfully dyed praline and sugar. And then there’s the wine. Lyon is tied to two famous wine regions – <em> Côtes du Rhône and Beaujolais </em> , and not far from a number of others, as well. This city is definitely worth visiting. Enjoy the gallery ! </p>

    <h3> NICE </h3>
    <p> Nice, the fifth most populous city in France, is the <strong > most iconic location </strong> in the French Riviera.

    <h3> MARSEILLE </h3>  
    <p> Marseille is <strong> France’s oldest city </strong> and one of the oldest in Western Europe. Its timeline goes all the way back to <strong> 600 BC </strong>  when the region was settled by ancient Greeks. Marseille's geographical position along the Mediterranean sea allowed the outpost to serve as an important port city throughout much of its history. Its inhabitants are known for their warmth and distinctive southern accent.  For those who only picture France as Paris, farms, or chateaux, Marseille will probably come as a surprise: its bold culture is closer to Italy than the stereotypical image of France. If you love architecture,<em> Notre Dame de la Garde </em> is the city’s iconic church, and definitely worth a look.A short trip outside the city,<em> Les Calanques </em> is the rocky terrain along the Mediterranean coast. It’s a favorite with visitors and locals alike. In recent decades, the city has developed into a popular tourist destination with around  <strong> 4 million visitors </strong> a year.

    <h3> BORDEAUX </h3>   
      <p> Well known for its distinct and coveted namesake wine, Bourdeaux is considered the <strong> wine capital of the world  </strong>. More than <strong> 700 million </strong> bottles of wine are produced here every year. Bordeaux wine ranges from simple table wine to some of the most prestigious wines in the world. Bordeaux’s <strong> impressive buildings </strong> , like the stunning <em> Place de la Bourse </em> and the <Em>Porte Cailhu </em> , once a part of the medieval city’s wall, contrast wildly with the vibrant, fun culture of college students, who make up a sizeable portion of the city’s population.

<h3> TOULOUSE</h3>
<p> Toulouse is nicknamed <em> la villa rose </em>, or the<em> “pink city”</em>, for its buildings comprised of signature light red terra cotta bricks made from the river Garonne's reddish mud. It’s a beautiful and unique place to visit. The city grew into prominence during the 15th century as a major producer of blue dye. Toulouse was among the wealthiest cities in France, but the economy took a major hit when a cheaper alternative pigment, indigo, was introduced from India. If you’re a fan of Romanesque architecture, you may already have the <em> Basilica of Saint-Sernin </em> on your bucket list.  You can admire more <strong> impressive architecture </strong>(from a few centuries later) or just enjoy the ambiance in the <em> Place du capitale </em>, the city’s lively main square. Toulouse offers a lot of interesting things to do for several subcultures, as well, from artists’ squats, to aeronautics (it’s the headquarters of French aviation giant Airbus). The <em> Toulouse Space Centre </em> is the <strong> largest space center </strong> in Europe. Take a look at some photos !</p>

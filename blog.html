        <p> Surface Neo is a device that features two LCDs that are joined together by a unique hinge design that allows the screens to be used together via multitasking or individually. It's designed like a book, but can be used in many different postures such as a laptop or tablet when needed as well. The displays themselves are 9-inches each, which totals 13.1-inches of screen real-estate when both are in use together.When closed, the device is 11.2mm thin, making both halves 5.6mm when open. It's also 655 grams, which is a little on the heavier side but adds to the overall premium feel of the device. On the outside, the device is covered in glass, which is a departure from other Surface products that historically use magnesium or aluminum. It is running Windows 10 X operating system which designed and optimized for lightweight computing. It has new and refreshed UX which includes a variety of new features to make computing easy.</p>
        <p> Microsoft claims that Surface Neo is expected to launch Holiday 2020. So far it is looking promising and futuristic we can't wait to see it. </p>

<h2 id="post2" > LG Signature OLED TV </h2> 
<h6>Posted on October 13, 2019 </h6>

<p> LG Electronics has announced groundbreaking rollable tv at CES 2019 in Las Vegas and it is out of this world. WELCOME TO THE FUTURE FOLKS ! This is a TV that’s there when you want it and disappears when you don’t. Not everyone loves having a big, black rectangle as the focal point of their living room, and plenty of people don’t own a TV at all. TV makers are starting to realize that, for some, it comes down to aesthetics, so they’re designing products that blend better into the home.</p>

<p>Turned off, the "TV" is just a piece of furniture reminiscent of a minimalist, modern sideboard or credenza: a low-slung stand supporting a sleek silver box. Cloth conceals a Dolby Atmos sound system and a full-width sliding door on the top back conceals the screen itself. Power the TV on and the door slides back and the screen slowly majestically rises out of the box, unrolling and achieving its full height in a few seconds. And suddenly, there's a big TV.
Press the button again to power it off and the TV screen goes black and descends back into its box, the door slides shut and it's furniture again. It's like no TV you've ever seen.  LG has designed a special home page for this short, wide screen shape, and it can display a clock with weather, personal photos or moving ambient designs. And the screen can disappear completely while music plays -- the set's sound system can interface with your phone via Bluetooth. </p>

<p> LG also added a support for Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and even Apple AirPlay 2 in theri webOS TV software. Company insists that customers don’t lose or sacrifice anything in terms of picture quality by picking a rollable display over one of the rigid, standard OLED sets; this is supposed to be up there with the company’s very best when it comes to brightness, contrast, and features the same second-generation Alpha 9 processing chip as LG’s other 2019 TVs. You get all of the OLED hallmarks like perfect blacks, great viewing angles, and a wide mix of vivid HDR color. </p>

<h2 id="post3" > ASUS ZenBook Pro Duo </h2> 
<h6>Posted on October 14, 2019 </h6>
<p> Most of us have laptops with one screen, right ? Well if that is not enough ASUS has a solution. They've introduced a powerful laptop with TWO sreens so you can multitask lika a pro. Let'see what this new ZenBook Pro Duo can do. </p>

<p>Its biggest selling point is the second 4K display, known as the Screenpad Plus. Essentially, it’s a supercharged Touch Bar – but while Apple’s slim screen (which also sits above the keyboard) is limited to shortcuts and icons, the much larger Screenpad Plus is able to show whole applications. ASUS introduced something new and with the ZenBook Pro Duo – the design language is very different.
The first thing you’ll notice when you open up the box and take out the laptop is how thick and heavy it is. With dimensions of 0.94 x 14.13 x 9.68-inches (2.4 x 35.9 x 24.6cm) and a weight of 2.5 kg.
That second screen is the main reason why, on opening the laptop, the ZenBook Pro Duo feels like a futuristic laptop, despite its size and weight. </p>

</center>
<p>The dual screen setup of the ZenBook Pro Duo is by far its biggest selling point, and its most noticeable feature. The top screen is a gorgeous looking 15.6-inch 4K OLED touchscreen, and that OLED technology coupled with the 3,840 x 2,160 resolution results in simply stunning image quality. 
Colors are vibrant and contrast is excellent, and the top screen alone means this is a laptop that you should consider if you’re looking for a machine to edit photos and videos on. Windows 10 treats the Screenpad Plus as a second monitor, so when you drag the mouse cursor to the bottom of the top screen, it will then appear on the bottom screen – and the reverse happens when you move the mouse to the top of the second screen. As the Screenpad Plus is a touchscreen, you can use your fingers to move or select open apps, or use the included Asus Pen stylus, essentially turning the Screenpad Plus into a drawing tablet – making it a tempting choice for digital artists. </p>
<p> This ZenBook Pro Duo is made for professionals so it has amazing specs and it will do things smooth and fast thanks to Intel i7-9750 processor or octa - core Intel i9-9980 HK. It has Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 graphic card and it can be configured with up 32 GB of RAM memory. However powerful specs and two OLED screens require more power. This laptop can a bit more than five hours but usage vary by users. </p>
<p> With this laptop you can run and use multiple apps on two screen and be sure that your tasks will run smoothly and I think lots of people will fall in love with this unique device. </p>
